# Error Handling

## Introduction

This is where are the error handling studies. The error handling can be done with the try-catch-finally block, using the following structure:

´´´
    try {
        // Code to execute

    } catch (Exception) {
        // Code to execute if Exception is thrown

    } finally {
        // Code to execute wheter the Exception is thrown or not

    }
´´´
