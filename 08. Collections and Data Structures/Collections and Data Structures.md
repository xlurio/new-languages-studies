# Collections and Data Structures

## Introduction

This is where are the collections and data structures usage studies. Similar data can often be stored in together and manipulated as a collection.


## Arrays

The only built-in collection on C is the array. It can be declared as such:

```
int mark[5];
int mark[] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};
int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};
```


### Indexing

To access a specific element in a array you can pass the index of the character after the a string object between brackets:

´´´
int mark[] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};

printf("%i", hello[0])
// Output: 19
´´´
