## Introduction

This is where are the struct declaration studies.


# Declaring

To declare a struct you can do the following:

```
struct MyStructure {   // Structure declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
}; // End the structure with a semicolon
```
